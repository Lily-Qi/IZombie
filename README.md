## Train an agent
All four algorithms mentioned in our paper are included in the folder [izombie_ipynbs](https://github.com/Lily-Qi/IZombie/tree/main/izombie_ipynbs). 
Each notebook contains completed code of training an agent to play IZombie, including installing the dependency of the simulator, setting up the environment, implementing DDQN/RainbowDQN with MLP/LSTM, and training the agent. Choose the one you want to run according to its name and just run all cells.
